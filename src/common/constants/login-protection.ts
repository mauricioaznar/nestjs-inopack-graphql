// validated here, and consumed through the exported objects so call sites never
// touch `process.env` directly.
//
// The two protections are independent and complementary:
//   • rate limiting is per IP and short-window — it slows an attacker (or a
//     runaway client) hammering the login endpoint;
//   • lockout is per account and IP-independent — it stops a distributed
//     password-guessing attack that spreads its attempts across many IPs to stay
//     under the per-IP limit.

// accounts, and a distinct "your account is locked" would confirm both that the
