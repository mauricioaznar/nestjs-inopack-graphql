/*
 * LEARNING MAP — backend session lifecycle
 *
 * Read the public methods in this order:
 *
 * 1. `loginWithCredentials` checks the password and creates a new session.
 * 2. `rotateRefreshToken` keeps that session alive without asking for the
 *    password again. It spends the old refresh token and creates a new one.
 * 3. `logout` ends the session represented by the refresh-token family.
 *
 * Two different tokens are involved:
 *
 * - The access token is a short-lived signed JWT. The frontend sends it on
 *   GraphQL requests, and the API can validate it without querying the DB.
 * - The refresh token is a long-lived random secret. Only its SHA-256 hash is
 *   stored in the DB; the browser carries the raw value in an httpOnly cookie.
 *
 * A `family_id` means "one login session". Every rotation adds a row to the
 * same family. Revoking the family therefore signs out that device/session,
 * while a separate login on another device has a different family.
 *
 * This service never writes cookies or HTTP responses. `AuthController` owns
 * that transport boundary and splits the `TokenPair` returned here.
